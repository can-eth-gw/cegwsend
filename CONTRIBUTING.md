Contributing
============

We are happy for any contribution, but you have to notice some rules:

Coding
------

We are strictly following the [Linux Kernel Code Style guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle) `[LINUX-KERNEL-SRC]/Documentation/CodingStyle`.
In general we use [astyle with `--style=linux`](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html#_style=linux) option to check and automatically format the source code files accoring to the guide.

The code must be well commented and according documentation have to be updated. We use [doxygen](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html#cppblock) for function documentation and as general format.

Your Contribution
-----------------

Every contribution is welcome. And we always searching for keen developers.

If you show us some improvements to the code you can get write access to the repository so that you can work on yourself.
