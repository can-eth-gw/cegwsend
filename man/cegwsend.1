.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Send Utility for testing non ip\-based ethernet interfaces.
You can send with this utility an ethernet package with raw data or with
an CAN/CAN\-FD Frame as payload.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[B]\-s\f[], \f[B]\-\-src\f[]=\f[I]SRC\-MAC\f[]
The MAC address, which should be written down in the SOURCE field of the
ethernet header.
In the current version this option is NOT USED.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-d\f[], \f[B]\-\-dst\f[]=\f[I]DST\-MAC\f[]
The MAC address, which should be written down in the DESTINATION field
of the ethernet header.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-t\f[], \f[B]\-\-type\f[]=\f[I]ETHERTYPE\f[]
Set the EtherType of the Ethernet frame.
\[aq]\f[B]ipv4\f[]\[aq], \[aq]\f[B]ipv6\f[]\[aq], \[aq]\f[B]can\f[]\[aq]
and \[aq]\f[B]canfd\f[]\[aq] can be translated to their hexadcimal code.
All other types must be written like \[aq]\f[B]0x1234\f[]\[aq] or
\[aq]\f[B]1234\f[].
Please note that the last example is a hexadecimal number, too.
\[aq]\f[B]none\f[]\[aq] can be used for experimental purposes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-r\f[], \f[B]\-\-raw\f[]=\f[I]RAW\f[]
The raw data that should be sent.
Please notice that the raw data must be typed in the console as a
hexadecimal number like this "01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef", for example.
You can use capital letters for A, B, C, D, E and F, of course.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-i\f[], \f[B]\-\-interface\f[]=\f[I]IFACE\f[]
The name of the Ethernet Interface, that is going to receive the message
